     <p>Snuggling up together on the couch with your little munchkins, an entertaining flick and a giant bowl of popcorn is hands down one of the best ways to enjoy some quality family time. But deciding on a film that everybody wants to watch ainâ€™t easy (cue the sibling bickering).Dim the lights, prepare your snacks and enjoy.</p>

     <p>From classic musicals, princess tales, and animated animals to superhero adventures and holiday favorites, these must-see movies will appeal to the whole family. Like the newer films honored with our Common Sense Seal, these all-time favorites are not only hugely entertaining, but they're packed with positive messages and role models, giving them the potential for significant impact on kids and families. Some are cultural touchstones. Others give kids a look at other worlds -- both real and imaginary. Many will bring on gales of laughter, and some might lead to a few tears. But all are worthy of a comfy couch, a bowl of fresh popcorn, and some family togetherness.</p>
